# FTC Team Level Up 9261 Cascade Classifier Tutorial
To follow this tutorial, first clone the repository using git or by simply downloading a zip folder. Next, go into the Training Arena/tools directory and unzip all of the different tools folders. Finally, delete the t.txt file in every Training Arena subdirectory. After you have done this, you can either use the Training Arena for your own Cascade Classifier experiments, or follow the tutorial. The tutorial assumes that you have already done this, and is located on the wiki.

## Dependencies
This tutorial uses some tools, like desc_format, which are coded in Python and so you must download Python in order to correctly train your cascade (unless you want to do the tools' fucntions by hand). Python will likely be phased out eventually in favor of converting the .py tools to .exe tools. The latest version of Python can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
