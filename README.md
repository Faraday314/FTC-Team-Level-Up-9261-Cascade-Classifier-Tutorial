To follow this tutorial, first clone the repository using git or by simply downloading a zip folder. Next, go into the Training Arena/tools directory and unzip all of the different tools folders. Finally, delete the t.txt file in every Training Arena subdirectory. After you have done this, you can either use the Training Arena for your own Cascade Classifier experiments, or follow the tutorial. The tutorial assumes that you have already done this, and is located on the wiki.
