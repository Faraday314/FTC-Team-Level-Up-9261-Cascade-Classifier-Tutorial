# FTC Team Level Up 9261 Cascade Classifier Tutorial
To follow this tutorial, first clone the repository using git or by simply downloading a zip folder. Next, go into the Training Arena/tools directory and unzip all of the different tools folders. Finally, delete the t.txt file in every Training Arena subdirectory. After you have done this, you can either use the Training Arena for your own Cascade Classifier experiments, or follow the tutorial. The tutorial assumes that you have already done this, and is located on the wiki.

## Necessary Installs
To use the programs on this tutorial, you currently have to install Python and Microsoft Visual Studio. Python will likely be phased out eventually in favor of converting the .py tools to .exe tools, but Microsoft Visual Studio is likely to stick around for a while.
The latest version of Python can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the latest version of Visual Studio can be downloaded [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
